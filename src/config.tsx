          Figmatic - Webflow service Agency company. I worked on a project
          Boltflow, which given a website link would crawl the whole site and
          estimate the price to build it in webflow. I built crawling apis,
          which would crawl the whole site identify the integrations ,
          distinguish page as a dynamic or static pages and take screenshot and
          estimate the cost for individual pages.
